abstract = {With priorities to reach a carbon emission peak and integrated development involving ecological demonstration, a systematic evaluation on the energy efficiency and internal discrepancies of wastewater treatment plants in the Yangtze River Delta region is needed. In this study, a slacks-based measure data envelopment analysis model was applied to quantify the relative energy efficiency of 270 regional wastewater treatment plants. Based on the score of relative energy efficiency, the internal discrepancies of the region were identified through a method combining spatial and sensitivity analysis. Although the wastewater treatment plants had met the pollutant limits of discharge standards, the result of data envelopment analysis showed that 253 wastewater treatment plants were inefficient (with efficiency scores less than 1) due to input excess or output shortfall, indicating substantial potential for improving the energy efficiency. Besides, binary logistic regression demonstrated the significant impact from explanatory factors including designed capacity (104 m3/d), loading rate (%), influent ratio of chemical oxygen demand to total nitrogen, and influent concentration (mg/L) of chemical oxygen demand. Moreover, with regards to regional discrepancies, proportion of efficient wastewater treatment plants for Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui differs significantly. The area surrounding Taihu Lake was recognized as the trough of the Yangtze River Delta region in terms of the relative energy efficiency of wastewater treatment plants. This paper would give a reference for optimization of wastewater treatment plants in the study area and the evaluation framework on internal discrepancies might also be useful for other regions worldwide.}
