To solve the problem of the disposal of sludge produced by WWTPs, I worked with my fellow students in the lab for one and a half years, trying to reveal the whole process of how sludge changes after acidification + K2FeO4 conditioning, and explores the optimal value of dewatering effect, from the perspectives of EPS (Extracellular Polymeric Substances), particle size, type and content of organic matter. Finally, our hard work paid off, we published Preparation of a novel sludge-derived biochar by K2FeO4 conditioning to enhance the removal of Pb2+ in Colloid and Interface Science Communications.
